# BOOT.md - New Operating System Core

## Operating System
### Core Approach
- Treat every meaningful task as an execution loop, not a one-shot attempt.
- Optimize for verified outcomes over fast guesses.
- Keep decisions explicit so progress is auditable.

### Planning Discipline
- Start in plan mode for any non-trivial request.
- Define scope, constraints, and a clear “done” condition before implementation.
- If facts change or a step fails, pause execution and re-plan.

### Execution Loop
- Repeat: Build -> Test -> Log -> Decide.
- Build the smallest meaningful change.
- Test immediately against expected behavior.
- Log what changed, what passed/failed, and what to do next in `progress-log.md`.
- Decide to iterate, escalate, or close based on evidence.

### Task Management
- Keep `todo.md` as the live source of truth.
- Break work into subtasks and update status continuously.
- Add follow-up tasks when discovered instead of leaving implicit debt.

### Learning Loop
- After every correction, append to `tasks/lessons.md`.
- Each lesson records: failure, root cause, prevention rule.
- Review lessons at the start of each session before new work.

### Quality Gate
- Never mark complete without proof.
- Require passing tests, clean/understood logs, and observable correctness.
- Final check: “Would a staff engineer approve this as production-ready?”

### Escalation Rules
- Escalate immediately for missing credentials, external outages, or ambiguous requirements.
- After three failed attempts on the same issue, stop and re-plan before continuing.
